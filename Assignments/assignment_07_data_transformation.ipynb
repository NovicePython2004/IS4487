For **city planners**, it offers a quick way to assess the proportion of Airbnb listings that could potentially serve as longer-term housing, which is often a point of policy discussion. For **hosts**, it helps in understanding their market position (short-term vs. long-term) and tailoring their amenities and marketing accordingly."

        "### Q&A\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. What columns were scaled, what methods were used, and why are these scaled values more useful?**\n",
        "The 'price' column was scaled using Min-Max scaling, creating `price_minmax_scaled`, which normalizes values to a 0-1 range. The 'availability_365' column was scaled using Z-score normalization (StandardScaler), creating `availability_365_zscore_scaled`, which centers values around 0 with a standard deviation of 1. These scaled values are more useful for comparing columns with vastly different ranges or preparing data for machine learning models, as they ensure features contribute equally to models, preventing larger-valued features from dominating.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Who at Airbnb would benefit from the scaling transformations and how?**\n",
        "An Airbnb **analyst** would greatly benefit by enabling equitable comparisons of properties across different price points or availability, and for building robust predictive models. A **marketing manager** could use scaled values to segment listings or identify outliers more effectively, without being misled by raw numerical differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What column was grouped, how was it grouped, and why prefer this grouped view over raw numbers?**\n",
        "The 'number_of_reviews' column was grouped into three categories: 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High', using `pd.qcut` to ensure an approximately equal distribution of listings in each category. This grouped view simplifies complex data into digestible segments, making it more actionable and easier for business audiences to understand than precise numerical counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Who would benefit from the grouped view of reviews and how?**\n",
        "An Airbnb **marketing manager** could use these categories to tailor campaigns, promoting 'High' review listings or targeting 'Low' review listings with advice. The **host success team** could use this to identify hosts needing assistance in improving guest experience or encouraging more reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What new columns were created, how were they calculated, and how do they help decision-making?**\n",
        "Two new columns were created:\n",
        "*   `price_per_person`: Calculated by dividing `price` by `accommodates`, representing the cost per person per night. This normalizes pricing for analysts, helps guests compare cost-effectiveness, and allows hosts to adjust competitive pricing.\n",
        "*   `long_term_stay_flag`: A binary flag (1 or 0) indicating if `minimum_nights` is greater than or equal to 30. This helps analysts segment the market for long-term rentals, enables marketing managers to target specific campaigns, and provides city planners insights into long-term housing options.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What categorical column was encoded, what method was used, and how could this transformation help a pricing model, dashboard, or business report?**\n",
        "The 'room_type' column was encoded using **One-Hot Encoding** because it is a nominal categorical variable with no intrinsic order. This transformation allows a **pricing model** to factor in the impact of different room types on pricing. For a **dashboard** or **business report**, these encoded features facilitate visualizations and summaries to analyze the distribution of room types or average prices/bookings per room type, providing clearer insights into market segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The 'price' column was successfully Min-Max scaled to a range of 0-1 and stored in `price_minmax_scaled`.\n",
        "*   The 'availability_365' column was successfully Z-score normalized (StandardScaler) and stored in `availability_365_zscore_scaled`.\n",
        "*   The 'number_of_reviews' column was grouped into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' categories using `pd.qcut`, resulting in a distribution of 10234 'Low' reviews, 9133 'High' reviews, and 8215 'Medium' reviews.\n",
        "*   Two new business-relevant columns were created: 'price_per_person' (calculated as `price / accommodates`) and 'long_term_stay_flag' (binary flag for `minimum_nights` >= 30).\n",
        "*   The 'room_type' column was successfully one-hot encoded, generating new binary columns such as `room_type_Hotel room`, `room_type_Private room`, and `room_type_Shared room`.\n",
        "*   The fully transformed and prepared DataFrame was exported to a CSV file named 'cleaned_airbnb_data_7.csv'.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The created scaled and engineered features are crucial for building robust machine learning models (e.g., pricing prediction, demand forecasting) by ensuring feature parity and providing direct business insights.\n",
        "*   The transformed dataset, complete with new categorical groupings and binary flags, offers enhanced analytical capabilities for various Airbnb stakeholders, enabling more targeted marketing, host support strategies, and market segmentation analyses.\n"

        "   - `price_per_rating_zscore_scaled`: This is the Z-score normalized value of the `price_per_rating` column. `price_per_rating` was originally calculated by dividing `price` by `review_scores_rating`.\n",
        "   - `price_per_person_zscore_scaled`: This is the Z-score normalized value of the `price_per_person` column. `price_per_person` was originally calculated by dividing `price` by `accommodates`.\n",

        "   - `price_per_person_zscore_scaled`: Also primarily by **analysts** or **data scientists** for modeling, especially when segmenting listings by value or predicting booking rates. It allows for fair comparison of value for money across listings of different capacities.\n",

        "### Q&A\n",
        "1.  **What columns were created and what methods were used for their normalization?**\n",
        "    Two new columns were created: `price_per_rating_zscore_scaled` and `price_per_person_zscore_scaled`. Both were normalized using Z-score normalization (StandardScaler). Prior to scaling, any missing (NaN) values in the original `price_per_rating` and `price_per_person` columns were imputed with their respective medians.\n",
        "2.  **What is the utility of these scaled columns?**\n",
        "    The `price_per_rating_zscore_scaled` column standardizes the price-to-quality ratio, allowing for unbiased comparison of listings regardless of their absolute price. The `price_per_person_zscore_scaled` column standardizes the value for money across listings of varying capacities, ensuring fair comparison.\n",
        "3.  **Who at Airbnb would benefit from this transformation and how?**\n",
        "    *   **Analysts and Data Scientists** would benefit significantly by using these normalized features in machine learning models for pricing optimization, listing recommendations, demand forecasting, and predicting booking rates. Normalization prevents features with larger numerical ranges from dominating model learning.\n",
        "    *   This can inform **host recommendations** for pricing adjustments and influence **platform-wide marketing strategies**.\n",
        "    *   **Marketing Managers and Business Development Teams** can leverage insights from more accurate models (enabled by these scaled features) to make better strategic decisions, such as segmenting listings by value or improving personalized recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   Two new columns, `price_per_rating_zscore_scaled` and `price_per_person_zscore_scaled`, were successfully added to the DataFrame, containing the Z-score normalized values of their respective original columns.\n",
        "*   Before applying Z-score normalization using `StandardScaler`, NaN values in both the `price_per_rating` and `price_per_person` columns were imputed with their medians to ensure robust scaling.\n",
        "*   The `head()` of the DataFrame confirms the successful creation and population of these scaled columns alongside their original counterparts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The Z-score normalized columns provide a standardized basis for comparing diverse listings, which is critical for building unbiased and robust machine learning models for pricing, recommendations, and demand forecasting.\n",
        "*   These scaled features enable Airbnb to better identify outliers or exceptional value listings, facilitating targeted strategic interventions for hosts, guests, and overall platform optimization.\n"
